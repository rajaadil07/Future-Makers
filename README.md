# Future-Makers
Day 1 Reflection

Hello! Today, I finally got to join the program and meet my team as well as my mentor, Shoumik. I can really tell that Ms. Mishra and her team put a lot of effort to develop this program/curriculum for us. For the most part, today was sort of a refresher since I already have Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook on my computer. On top of that, I got a little more familiar to Numpy. I have previous experience in Numpy but it was good to clear up a few questions I had with Kunjal, so I could know how Numpy arrays were favored over Python lists. I wasn't able to experience my mentor meeting today since my Internet wasn't to my advantage, but I'm glad we were able to communciate through Slack and clear that up. I am excited to get going with the rest of this journey and learn as much as I can!

Day 2 Reflection

Hello! Today, I learned the power of storytelling! Though I didn't hear the full workshop, I learned that even if you have the slightest bit of detail missing, a story can be completely ruined. Dr. David Kong knew exactly what he was doing in sharing his story which was not only an interesting story, but it was also interesting from the sense in how he shared his story. His great stories motivated and encouraged me to have a dream and accomplish those dreams. Down the line when I become a little bit older and hopefully do accomplish my goals and aspirations, I hope to tell me stories in a similar fashion to Dr. Kong!

Day 3 Reflection

What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

Today, I learned about supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, our input data is labeled. So, for example if we want to predict if a picture is of a dog or cat, then we will give our model data that labels or shows a picture of an actual dog/cat so the model can learn from it. Unsupervised learning, is something that we don't prefer, but one which we may end up having. In unsupervised learning, our model learns from differnet patterns in our dataset. For example, from the sense of a dog and a cat, our model has to learn which unique characteristics both the dog and cat has to differentiate the two. 

Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

The following statement is false because Scikit-learn is used to process and manipulate our data/statistics. Scikit-learn does not necessarilly visualize data, rather we depend on libraries such as Matplotlib and Graphviz to plot and visualize this data.

Day 4 Reflection

Today we learned about deep learning. This subsection of AI/ML can be implemented within several industries. Deep learning algorithms can be used for detecting and identifying objects within some sort of image or a scan. Deep learning is very powerful especially in fields such as healthcare where we use DL algorithms to scan brains.
