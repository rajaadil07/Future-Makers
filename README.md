# Future-Makers
Day 1 Reflection

Hello! Today, I finally got to join the program and meet my team as well as my mentor, Shoumik. I can really tell that Ms. Mishra and her team put a lot of effort to develop this program/curriculum for us. For the most part, today was sort of a refresher since I already have Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook on my computer. On top of that, I got a little more familiar to Numpy. I have previous experience in Numpy but it was good to clear up a few questions I had with Kunjal, so I could know how Numpy arrays were favored over Python lists. I wasn't able to experience my mentor meeting today since my Internet wasn't to my advantage, but I'm glad we were able to communciate through Slack and clear that up. I am excited to get going with the rest of this journey and learn as much as I can!

Day 2 Reflection

Hello! Today, I learned the power of storytelling! Though I didn't hear the full workshop, I learned that even if you have the slightest bit of detail missing, a story can be completely ruined. Dr. David Kong knew exactly what he was doing in sharing his story which was not only an interesting story, but it was also interesting from the sense in how he shared his story. His great stories motivated and encouraged me to have a dream and accomplish those dreams. Down the line when I become a little bit older and hopefully do accomplish my goals and aspirations, I hope to tell me stories in a similar fashion to Dr. Kong!
