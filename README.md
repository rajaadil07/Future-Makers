# Future-Makers
Day 1 Reflection

Hello! Today, I finally got to join the program and meet my team as well as my mentor, Shoumik. I can really tell that Ms. Mishra and her team put a lot of effort to develop this program/curriculum for us. For the most part, today was sort of a refresher since I already have Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook on my computer. On top of that, I got a little more familiar to Numpy. I have previous experience in Numpy but it was good to clear up a few questions I had with Kunjal, so I could know how Numpy arrays were favored over Python lists. I wasn't able to experience my mentor meeting today since my Internet wasn't to my advantage, but I'm glad we were able to communciate through Slack and clear that up. I am excited to get going with the rest of this journey and learn as much as I can!
